# Password Generator and Strength Checker

This code provides a simple password generator and a password strength checker. It allows users to generate strong passwords or test the strength of passwords they provide.

## Features

The code includes the following features:

1. **Password Generation**: The `generate_secure_password()` function generates a secure password based on the defined criteria. The generated password has a length of 12 characters and includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.

2. **Password Strength Analysis**: The `analyze_password_strength(password)` function tests the strength of a given password. It checks if the password meets the following criteria:
   - Minimum length: The password must have a minimum length of 8 characters.
   - Uppercase letter: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
   - Lowercase letter: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.
   - Digit: The password should contain at least one digit.
   - Special character: The password should contain at least one special character.
   - Common patterns: The password should not contain common patterns or easily guessable sequences (e.g., "123456", "password", "qwerty", "admin").

3. **User Interaction**: The code prompts the user for choices until they enter "quit." The user can select one of the following options:
   - Generate a secure password: The code generates a secure password and displays it.
   - Test the strength of a password: The user can input a password, and the code analyzes its strength based on the defined criteria.
   - Quit: The user can type "quit" to exit the program.

## Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system.

2. Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `password_generator.py`).

3. Run the Python file.

4. The program will display a menu with options:
   - Enter `1` to generate a secure password.
   - Enter `2` to test the strength of a password.
   - Enter `quit` to exit the program.

5. If you choose option `1` (generate a secure password), the program will generate a strong password and display it.

6. If you choose option `2` (test the strength of a password), the program will prompt you to enter a password. After entering the password, it will analyze its strength based on the defined criteria and display the result.

7. Repeat the steps as needed. To exit the program, enter `quit`.

**Note:** It is always recommended to use a strong and unique password for each account you create.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the code, you can modify the following parameters:

- **Password Length**: To change the length of the generated secure password, modify the `length` variable in the `generate_secure_password()` function.

- **Minimum Password Length**: To change the minimum length required for a password to be considered strong, modify the `min_length` variable in the `analyze_password_strength(password)` function.

- **Common Patterns**: To add or remove common patterns that should be avoided in passwords, modify the `common_patterns` list in the `analyze_password_strength(password)` function.

- **Password Criteria**: To adjust the password criteria (e.g., requiring or disallowing certain characters), modify the corresponding conditions in the `generate_secure_password()` and `analyze_password_strength(password)` functions.

## Security Considerations

While this code aims to generate strong passwords and analyze their strength, it is important to consider additional security measures:

1. **Secure Storage**: Ensure that passwords are securely stored, such as using a password manager or encrypted storage.
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable two
